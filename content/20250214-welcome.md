"Security Unscripted" is a new podcast for insightful, no-nonsense discussions on the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity. In each short, engaging episode, we’ll dive into a variety of security topics, shining a light on challenges and opportunities that impact us all.

Our focus? Primarily, although not exclusively, open source software—a crucial part of our lives, yet often misunderstood when it comes to software security. Taking a vendor-neutral perspective, we’ll explore how open source impacts the security landscape and how we can better understand it.

With over 20 years of experience in the industry, I bring my insights to the table, joined by thought-provoking guests who share their unique perspectives. Together, we aim to inspire meaningful conversations, spark new ideas, and maybe even drive a little change in how we approach security.

And let’s not forget to keep it real—because when it comes to security, sometimes the unscripted moments reveal the most.

So, whether you’re a seasoned pro or just curious, join us for an open and engaging journey into the world of security—unscripted, unfiltered, and always worth your time.
