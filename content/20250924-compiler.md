This is a brief interruption to note that some security is semi-scripted.  I have been working on another project as co-host for the [Compiler podcast](https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast)'s upcoming season: _The New Security Landscape_.  While it would be untrue to say this is the reason these podcasts have slowed down to roughly once per month (once a week turned out to be a little too ambitious!), I'm noting it here because the upcoming 8-episode season is entirely devoted to security so if you like _Security Unscripted_ you'll love the new season of the _Compiler podcast_.

The first episode should be released tomorrow, and you'll be able to find them on the [Compiler podcast on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbMP1JcGBmSHm_7mTlGb90EApbAHkx5Gp) but in the meantime, here's the trailer.
