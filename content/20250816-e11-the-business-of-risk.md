Stop reporting on vulnerabilities and start talking about business risk. In this episode, Phil Moroni from Phoenix Security and I tackle a critical challenge: how to find and articulate security weaknesses in a way that truly matters to the business. We discuss why focusing on the complete exploitation vector, from software flaws to system misconfigurations, is essential for a realistic security posture. If you're looking for a better way to frame security conversations and demonstrate the tangible impact of your work, this episode is for you.
