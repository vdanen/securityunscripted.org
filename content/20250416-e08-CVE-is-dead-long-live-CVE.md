What was meant to be a recap about VulnCon 2025 last week had to change due to the recent news and speculations around the future of the CVE program due to the announcement that funding was to be cut for CVE as of April 16, 2025 and less than 24h funding was made available by CISA.  In that very short time frame there was a LOT of speculation and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and new efforts springing up to help.  But what happened and what's the right way to fix this?  Ironically, last week I was talking about the future of the CVE program and 5 days later what seemed to be impossible happened, with fireworks.  This episode talks about my thoughts and opinions about the future of CVE, the problems we have and why the kneejerk responses around the calamity that is the perceived death of CVE are not at all helpful.  There's no reason to panic, things are well underway, and the future will be bright!
